                    <h3>Message from the Chairman</h3>
                      <p>Dear all students:</p>
                      
                      <p>
                      I would like to congratulate you for your outstanding performance in the entrance examination. I believe that everyone will benefit much from their period of study at National Taipei University of Technology and gained much knowledge not only from the professional field of civil engineering but also in everyday life.
                      </p>
                      
                      <p>
                      Upon entering this program, you are already on the foundation set by the alumni and you also carry the responsibility to pass down a customs of excellence. Back in the early ages of 1912, the Japanese chair system established the School of Industrial Instruction and the civil program under it is the precursor of our current program. Our program established the "Graduate Institute of Civil and Disaster Prevention Engineering" in 1997, and the doctoral program of the "Graduate Institution of Engineering Technology" established the "Civil and Disaster Prevention Engineering Division" to further focus on in this research field.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                      The alumni have carried the responsibility for the welfare of the society and it is because of their exceptional performances that establish our terrific reputation. I wish you can carry on these excellent traditions.
                      </p>
                      <p>With my best wishes,</p>
                      <p>Wen-I Liao</p>
